# Retailer scoring

Retailer scoring allow to compare the performance of different retailers, brands or products on a set of KPIs [link]

There are two ways to generate scoring.

## RFIs

This is the most solid method to generate a scorecard. It is based on a questionnaire sent to retailers, asking them to provide information about their Media platform. The answers are then scored by the user who have knowledge of the retailer's platform and the Commerce landscape.

If one same RFI has been sent to multiple different retailers, then retailers can be compared against each other on the same set of KPIs.

Users can also create a "segment", which allows to set weigthings on some specific categories (e.g Audio should have a higher weight than Display).
When comparing different retailers through the lens of a segment, retailers with better scores on Audio will be ranked higher than retailers with better scores on Display.

## Custom Scorecards

Custom scorecards are generated by the Commerce team who, based on their knowledge of a retailer in a specific market, will score the retailer on a set of KPIs.
